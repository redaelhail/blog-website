My name is Reda, a Phd in KU Leuven Belgium, working on machine learning applied on radar sensors data to recognize human indoor activities.
My goal is to prove that its possible to recognize indoor activities for single/multiple persons using a single FMCW radar sensor. Another goal is to be able to run the pre-processing and the prediction algorithm on the edge.
