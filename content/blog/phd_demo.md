These videos show a demonstration of indoor human activity recognition using FMCW radar and machine learning. The radar is placed in h roof and it has a field of view covering 120 degrees in all directions.

This demo runs a convolutional neural network that was trained on a previously collected dataset in the same environment with different people.
